Paper.js seems to have issues loading files from the local file system.
In order to correct this, we can set up an http server, using python.

REQUIREMENTS
	install python on your computer
	make sure you can call python from the terminal

1. Open the terminal, and cd to the project directory, where we have index.html
2. type "python -m SimpleHTTPServer"
	a.	if that doesn't work, and you have Python3 installed, type "python -m http.server"
3. view local changes by visiting "localhost:8000" or "127.0.0.1:8000" in your browser.
